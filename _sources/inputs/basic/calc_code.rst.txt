How to set calculator

The calculator can contain more than one number to represent multiple structural optimizations. 
For example, "calculator = 1 1 1" means that 3 structural optimizations are performed using calculator1.

A calculator can contain a mixture of numbers, indicating that the structure is optimized with a different
calculator each time. For example, "calculator = 2 1" means that the structure is first optimized by 
calculator2 and then by calculator1.

.. warning::

    If "calculator = 2" (empirical potential) is used for the last structural optimization, the accuracy of the 
    results may be affected. Therefore it is recommended to "calculator1" last.
